# Serial Listener and Logger (SeLL)
Simple Python script to listen for communication on a serial port, timestamp every line and save it to a file named by the date.

The settings.txt file should have all the information required to communicate to the port and to save the files. The files are compressed (gz) at the end of the day to save space.
## Modules required
* **pyserial**
* **time**
* **subprocess**
